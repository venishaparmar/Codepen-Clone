#Codepen | Clone 
### Created Using ReactJS and Material UI

This project is a CodePen clone built using Material UI and React.js. It is a web-based editor where users can work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the results are shown below the editor in real time. This project is created to enhance my ReactJs skills and also to practice Material UI for the first time.

It uses Material UI components to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The code editor is powered by CodeMirror, which provides a rich editing experience with syntax highlighting, code folding, and linting. The results are rendered using React DOM, which ensures that they are displayed correctly in all browsers.

Here I have attached a short video demonstrating this project output.
